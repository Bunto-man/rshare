GOALS
  This project aims to take back control for sending and recieving data acrossed devices. 
THE MISSION
  Before this project, Opera GX MyFlow, GDrive, E-mail, and any other system could connect a device for file sharing. This method was slow, unreliable, 
  could not be performed for larger files like videos. Opera GX especially had a dedicated system for file sharing, but could only pair one phone to one computer,
  and would often delete files after some time.
OPERATION
  On running this file, your LAN IP address will be shown in terminal. Simply go to the weblink or go to your local host as displayed. 
  File limits can be configured to be larger. the default is 1GB. ->>>.layer(DefaultBodyLimit::max(1024 * 1024 * 1024)); under router settings in the code file.
  (AT THE MOMENT) There is currently NO PASSWORD for the program. Anyone on your local internet can see your file-share server if they type your IP and port  in the search bar while the program is running.
