**Rust-powered LAN file sharing** â€“ fast, private, and under your control.
Take back control of sending and receiving data across devices without relying on
cloud services or slow proprietary apps.
Before **rShare**, sharing large files often meant:
- Clunky email attachments
- Limited services like Opera GX MyFlow (one device pair, auto-deletes files)
- Slow uploads to Google Drive or other clouds

rShare fixes that with a **direct LAN connection** for instant, reliable transfers.
